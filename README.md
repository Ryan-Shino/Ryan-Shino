# Hi, I'm Ryan Shino

I'm a **second-year Computer Science student at the University of Southampton** with a passion for building practical software and solving challenging problems.

I’m actively seeking a **software engineering internship for Summer 2026**, where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with experienced engineers, and continue growing my skills.

## Currently Learning & Building

Currently in **Year 2**, I’m bridging the gap between software development, data analysis, and operations:

- **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Building a **"Mini Production-Like Web Service"** running inside a Linux VM. This involves setting up **Docker containers**, implementing **CI/CD pipelines**, and configuring system monitoring.
- **Problem-solving:** Practicing on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.
- **Year 2 Coursework:** Theory of Computation, Artificial Intelligence, Functional Programming.
- **Group Project:** Collaborating to build a full-stack application using Agile methodologies.
